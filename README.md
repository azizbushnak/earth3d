# earth3d

*Earth3D allows you to visually represent your data on a 3D Earth.*

We have created a simulation which contains a 3D model Earth and a free-floating camera which can orbit the Earth and view the model from every angle. This allows for some very interesting data visualisation methods, for example interactive data sets to video files with information over time. The code is made using a language called Processing, which is basically just Java but with some more graphic commands.
